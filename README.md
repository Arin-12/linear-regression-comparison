Linear Regression Model Comparison
This contains Python code that demonstrates and compares three different implementations of linear regression:

Custom Linear Regression Model (My_LR): A simple implementation of linear regression from scratch.
Scikit-learn's LinearRegression: A standard implementation of linear regression using the scikit-learn library.
Scikit-learn's SGDRegressor: An implementation of linear regression using Stochastic Gradient Descent from scikit-learn.
Scikit-learn's Ridge: An implementation of Ridge regression from scikit-learn.
The code generates synthetic data, splits it into training and testing sets, trains each model, makes predictions, and evaluates their performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) score. It also includes visualizations of the model's predictions against the test data.
